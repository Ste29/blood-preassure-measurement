# bloop-pressure-measurement

Neural network algorithm from my master thesis on cuffless blood pressure measurement. Original code was runned on google colab due to low computational power on my pc. Data were extracted from MIMIC database and preprocessed on matlab, for this reason the input of this net must be a matlab matrix.
The network achieved great performances on same patient tests, full details in my thesys.
